## 🌌 Vision: The DePIN Operating System for AI Agents

We are entering an era where AI agents will autonomously transact, compute, and negotiate. Today’s cloud infrastructure is centralized, expensive, and opaque. BNB Edge DePIN Node is the first decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) purpose-built for autonomous AI agents on BNB Chain.

Instead of treating GPUs and storage as simple commodities, we provide a verifiable, reputation-driven marketplace where:

- Hardware is cryptographically proven (no more GPU spoofing).
- AI agents have portable, on-chain identities (ERC-8004 / BAP-578).
- Reliability is enforced by smart contracts (enterprise SLAs with automated penalties).
- Payments are stable, instant, and gasless (USDC on opBNB).

## 🏛️ Core Architecture: 7 Smart Contracts

Our modular architecture separates concerns for maximum flexibility and security.

- `NodeRegistry.sol`: Stake, heartbeat, reputation, slashing.
- `AgentRegistry.sol`: ERC-8004 agent identity + BAP-578 NFAs.
- `JobMarketplace.sol`: Job escrow, assignment, reverse auction.
- `ReputationOracle.sol`: On-chain AI scoring (history + prediction).
- `PoRepLite.sol`: Proof-of-Replication GPU challenges.
- `ServiceLevelAgreement.sol`: Tiered SLAs with automated penalties.
- `StorageManager.sol`: IPFS file storage, reassignment.

## ✨ Legendary Features

### 1. Verifiable AI Agent Identity (ERC-8004 & BAP-578)
We are the first to implement ERC-8004, the new Ethereum standard for AI agent identity, and BAP-578, BNB Chain’s Non-Fungible Agent specification.

### 2. Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) Lite – GPU Hardware Verification
Before a GPU node is listed, it must complete a time-boxed compute challenge (MobileNetV3 inference) to prove its hardware claims.

### 3. Enterprise SLAs with Automated On-Chain Penalties
Tiered SLAs (BASIC, GOLD, PLATINUM) with automated penalty payouts from node stake if reliability targets are missed.

### 4. Built in Public: Live, Verifiable Build Log
A dedicated timeline fetching GitHub commits to prove development transparency and protocol evolution.

### 5. Reverse Auction Engine & AWS Cost Comparator
Nodes bid down prices in real-time, often reaching 70-80% savings compared to AWS/GCP.
